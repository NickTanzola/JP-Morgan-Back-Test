# JP-Morgan-Back-Test
Back test of JP Morgan's Volatility Index (VIX) based strategy. My goal was to replicate the findings discussed within this Bloomberg article: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-08/jpmorgan-strategists-see-sure-fire-sign-it-s-time-to-buy-stocks .
The buy signal is when VIX rises by more than 50% of its one month moving average. JP Morgan boasted this strategy to be 100% effective outside of recessions, so this is the claim I investigated.
